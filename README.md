# configs

Various config files for editors, etc. Color settings in the below files will not override ANSI settings for themes. See info in the below sections to override the shell's ansi settings.

## ZSH Shell Theme

Add `capndave.zsh-theme` to `~/.oh-my-zsh/themes`, then update `~/.zshrc` with `ZSH_THEME="capndave"`. It is recommended to also go to Terminal > Settings and see the ANSI Colors for a given theme. You can change the Green one to white and the cyan one to `#777777`

## VSCode Settings

Copy the contents of `settings.json` into the global `settings.json` for VSCode. Location for that file may vary.
